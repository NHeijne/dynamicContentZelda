-- If you want to translate the game, only translate the "text"
-- property of each dialog and leave other properties unchanged.
-- The meaning of all properties is specified at the end of this file
-- if you are interested.
-- See also http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/latest/translation.html
-- for general translation instructions.

-- ****** Please respect the limit of each line! ******
-- 23 chars for normal lines,
-- 20 chars for dialogs with an icon or lines that are answers to a question,
-- 17 chars for lines with both an icon and an answer.
-- Each dialog ends with a comment with dashes indicating the maximum line size.
-- Please don't exceed the maximum size of lines,
-- and don't break lines too early either.
-- Don't try to reproduce the exact same lines: it's normal for dialogs to be
-- shorter or longer than in the language you are translating from.
-- It's also normal for lines to end on different words.

-- ****** Typo warning! ******
-- Remember that ponctuation characters like ! ? : ; are preceeded by a space
-- character in French and NOT in English.

-- Thanks for your contribution!

They are hiding in a

the seal created by
the Solarus Amulet, the
relic worn by Zelda,

The mystery of Solarus
is kept safe inside
the relic.
The relic's owner has
the ability to summon
the Solarus power to
seal an object, a
place or even a world,
as the seven sages once
did when they sealed
away the Golden Land.
Zelda is the heiress of
that power. She used it
to seal the Triforce
shards, using the eight
beings created by the
Solarus.
Thus, as long as she
alone knows the secret
of the relic, she alone
masters the Triforce's
seal. This is why you
must protect the seal.

-- ****** Full specification of dialog properties ******

-- We describe here the meaning of each dialog property.

-- You will be interested in this documentation
-- if you are modifying this quest or making a
-- quest that uses the same dialog system.
-- If you are only translating the quest,
-- you must not change properties other than "text".

-- Remember that properties "id" and "text" are the only ones
-- imposed by the Solarus engine.
-- All other properties are custom, they work with
-- the specific dialog box system of Zelda Mystery of Solarus DX.
-- In other words, the documentation below relates to Zelda Mystery of
-- Solarus DX (or to any other quest that uses the same dialog box system),
-- but not to all Solarus quests.

-- In Zelda Mystery of Solarus DX, a dialog has the following properties:
--
-- - id (string): A name identifying the dialog.
--   The id allows the engine and the scripts to refer to the dialog whenever they
--   want to display it.
--   If you are translating dialogs, you must never translate the id.
--
-- - text (multi-line string): Contents of this dialog.
--   If you are translating dialogs, text is the only property to translate.
--   The text has usually several lines.
--   The text should be enclosed between [[ and ]], which is
--   the notation for multiline strings.
--   In the game, it will be displayed in groups of 3 lines because the dialog box
--   has space for 3 lines. Each group of 3 lines is called a message.
--   There is no automatic line breaking: you have to break your lines explicitly.
--   A line shoud not exceed the maximum number of characters that fit in the
--   dialog box. This limit depends on the font used.
--   To make sure you don't exceed the limit, you
--   should use a text editor with a fixed width font and that shows the column
--   number.
--   Hint: you can also put a special comment (outside the string!) whose only
--   purpose is to show the maximum line size.
--
-- - skip (string, optional): Defines what happens when the player
--   tries to skip the dialog (by pressing the attack command).
--   There are three possible values:
--   - "none" (default): The message cannot be skipped.
--   - "current": If the command is pressed, the current group of 3 lines
--     is immediately shown (instead of being displayed gradually, letter by
--     letter).
--     This allows to get to the next message faster.
--   - "all": The whole dialog can be skipped.
--     The dialog box is immediataly closed and
--     the subsequent groups of 3 lines will not be displayed at all.
--     Use this only for non-essential dialogs that can be read again later.
--   The value of skip takes effect applies until the dialog box is closed.
--
-- - icon (number, optional): displays a small image of 16x16 pixels in the
--   dialog box.
--   The value is a number that identifies the position of the icon in the icon
--   image file sprites/hud/dialog_icons.png.
--   The icon (if any) is displayed on the left of the dialog.
--   This takes space:
--   when an icon is shown, the whole text is shifted of 32 pixels to the right
--   in the dialog box. Therefore, there is less space for characters.
--   The icon remains displayed in the next message, until its value
--   is changed or the dialog box is closed. A value of -1
--   means that you want to remove the icon.
--
-- - next (string, optional): Id of the next dialog to display.
--   If this value is not set, the dialog box is closed
--   when the current dialog finishes.
--
--   During the last message (group of 3 lines) of a dialog,
--   if next is set, then an arrow is displayed on the
--   bottom of the dialog box to indicate that there will
--   be at least another message after this one.
--   If next is not set, then this arrow is replaced
--   by a square to indicate that this message is the last one.
--   A message having a question (see below) is always displayed
--   with an arrow.
--
--   Sometimes, even if a dialog is finished, you may
--   want to show an arrow.
--   This is typically the case when you know that another
--   dialog will start immediately, but you don't know which one yet
--   (a script will decide at the last moment). In this very specific
--   case, you can set an empty string ("") as the value of next
--   to indicate that the dialog will be followed by another one,
--   unknown for now.
--   This will display the arrow instead of the square, but everything
--   else works exactly as if the value next was not set.
--
-- - question (boolean, optional): If set to true, the last message
--   (group of 3 lines) of the dialog will be displayed as a question
--   with two choices.
--   The first line of the message is considered as the question
--   and the two other lines are the two possible answers.
--   A cursor lets the player choose its answer. The cursor takes space:
--   when there is a question, the whole text is shifted of 32 pixels to the right
--   in the dialog box. Therefore, there is less space for characters.
--   It is possible to have both a question and an icon: in this case, you have
--   even less space for the text.
--
-- - next2 (string, optional): If there is a question, you can define this
--   value next2. next specifies the message to show when the first answer
--   is selected. next2 specifies the message to show when the second answer
--   is selected.
--   As for next, if next2 is unspecified and the player chooses
--   the second answer, the sequence stops and the dialog box is closed.
--
-- There exists special characters that you can put in the text of a
-- dialog:
-- - $0: Makes a break of one second in the letter scrolling.
-- - $1: Sets the letter scrolling speed to slow.
-- - $2: Sets the letter scrolling speed to medium.
-- - $3: Sets the letter scrolling speed to fast (default).
--   Note that the letter scrolling speed applies until the dialog box is closed.
-- - $v: Inserts in the text some value that is only known at runtime
--   (for example the player's name or some money reward won in a mini-game).
--   The $v sequence is substituted by the appropriate value. The value
--   has to be specified at runtime by the quest programmer using the Lua API
--   (through the info parameter of game:start_dialog()).
